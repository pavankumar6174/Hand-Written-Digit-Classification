## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The ability to accurately predict handwritten digits has a wide range of applications, from automated address recognition to signature verification. This project uses the MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for digit recognition tasks.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict handwritten digits with a high level of accuracy. The model should take an input image of a handwritten digit and output the predicted digit (0-9). This project aims to explore different machine learning algorithms, techniques, and model architectures to achieve the best possible prediction accuracy.

## Data Source
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which is available through various machine learning libraries. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is a grayscale image with pixel values normalized to a range of 0 to 1.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-prediction.git
   cd digit-prediction
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the training script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. After training, you can use the trained model to predict handwritten digits by running the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py path/to/your/image.png
   ```

## Model Architecture
The project explores various model architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and ensemble methods. The architectures are defined and implemented in the `models.py` file.

## Performance
The performance of the trained models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The best-performing model is selected based on its performance on the validation dataset.
